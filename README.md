Project Overview
ZapDash is a workflow automation platform that enables users to create custom workflows between applications. Users can define dynamic triggers and actions to automate tasks, increasing efficiency and productivity. ZapDash integrates with multiple third-party services, making task automation seamless and intuitive.

Features
User authentication: OAuth 2.0 and JWT-based authentication for secure access.
Real-time processing: Kafka is used to handle task execution efficiently.
Dynamic workflows: Flexible trigger and action system to create custom workflows.
Scalability: Built with scalable architecture using Docker and PostgreSQL.
Third-party integration: Supports connecting various apps and services.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
Database: PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
Task Processing: Kafka
Containerization & Orchestration: Docker
Validation: Zod (for schema validation)
Authentication: NextAuth

Directory Descriptions:
frontend/: This folder contains the frontend code, built using React.js and Next.js. It handles the user interface and client-side logic for creating and managing workflows.

hooks/: This folder stores custom React hooks, which might be shared across different components in the frontend or between frontend and backend logic for utilities, API calls, or authentication.

primary-backend/: The main backend server, built using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript. It manages API requests, user authentication, and workflow logic. It connects to the PostgreSQL database and coordinates workflow execution.

processor/: This component is likely responsible for processing workflows or middleware logic. It could include operations like validating workflows, interacting with third-party APIs, or managing triggers and actions.

worker/: This folder contains the background processing logic, possibly involving Kafka for message queueing and asynchronous task processing. It handles tasks like sending notifications, scheduling jobs, or processing workflows that run in the background.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/athsb009/zapdash.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd zapdash
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../primary-backend && npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in both frontend and primary-backend directories and add necessary keys (e.g., DB_URL, JWT_SECRET, etc.).
Run Docker containers for backend services (Kafka, PostgreSQL, etc.):

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
Start the development servers:

For frontend:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend && npm run dev
For backend:
bash
Copy code
cd primary-backend && npm run dev
Usage
Once the development servers are running:

Access the app on http://localhost:3000 (frontend).
Sign up or log in.
Create custom workflows by selecting triggers and actions from the dashboard.
Connect third-party apps to automate tasks effortlessly.
